# Castle Game Engine - Empty Project

## Project Creation

This project was scaffolded using:

```bash
castle-engine create empty
```

This generates an "empty" template with a basic TCastleView, FPS label, and the standard project structure.

## Project Structure

- `CastleEngineManifest.xml` - Project manifest (name, version, build settings)
- `code/gameinitialize.pas` - Application initialization (creates window, loads settings, sets initial view)
- `code/gameviewmain.pas` - Main view with Update/Press handlers and FPS label
- `data/gameviewmain.castle-user-interface` - JSON design file defining the UI/3D scene
- `data/CastleSettings.xml` - Container settings (UI scaling, default font)
- `empty_standalone.dpr` - Delphi project file (standalone build entry point)
- `empty_standalone.lpi` - Lazarus project file
- `castleautogenerated.pas` - Auto-generated unit (do not edit manually)

## 3D Scene Setup

The design file (`data/gameviewmain.castle-user-interface`) contains:

- **TCastleViewport** (full-size) - The 3D viewport
  - **TCastleWalkNavigation** - First-person movement with WASD keys and mouse look (child of viewport)
- Inside viewport Items (TCastleRootTransform):
  - **TCastleCamera** at Y=1.8 (eye level)
  - **TCastlePlane** (100x100, green) - Ground to walk on
  - **TCastleBox** x3 - Colored box landmarks
  - **TCastleDirectionalLight** - Scene lighting
- **TCastleLabel** - FPS counter (top-right corner)

## Building and Running

Build (compile):
```bash
castle-engine compile
```

Run (compiles if needed, then runs):
```bash
castle-engine run
```

Clean build artifacts:
```bash
castle-engine clean
```

## Controls

- **WASD** - Move forward/backward/strafe left/right
- **Mouse** - Look around (click on window first to capture mouse)
- **Escape** - Release mouse / exit
